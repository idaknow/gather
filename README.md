ECE Part 4 Project, # 66: Medical Data Collection </br>
By Ida De Smet & Brittany Walker

## Proposed Project:

> The aim of the project is to create a prototype application that can extract health data from different sources. This would enable health professionals to access useful data about the patientâ€™s lifestyle. This application will give the user the ability to holistically view health data from multiple sources in one streamlined application. These sources may include health apps (such as Nike + Run Club), social apps (such as Facebook) and phone sensors. The two main goals will be to design a visually pleasing and highly usable GUI, and to figure out how best to collect the data from these sources.

## Outcome

> An android application that extracts data from various sources and has a usable GUI for the user.
